# Gingerbread House Engineering Challenge

![Comic about what to do with gingerbread houses](/images/gingerbread-comic-1.png)

## The Challenge
Your challenge *(should you choose to accept it)* is to create a unique gingerbread house that can protect a 2" person inside from an outside attack.

Awards for:
- Person saved
- Most creative
- Ugliest
- Best overall

## The Rules
In order to make it a fair competition and ensure your person has space to be comfortable, the gingerbread house must:
1. Be self-supporting with only edible, approved ingredients (ex: No 3D printing or non-edible support structures).
1. Have a minimum 3" width, 3" length, and 3" height AND 72 cubic inches volume. This means in order to hit the volume minimum, you will have to expand the width, length, or height on the dimension(s) of your choice.
1. Have maximum of 203 square inches of surface area to work with.

## Supplies
Everyone should have an equal amount of supplies to work with. They don't have to use it all, but set a maximum allowed for each.
- [One batch of gingerbread](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/gingerbread-for-a-gingerbread-house-3574999) for each person. *(This will give everyone the 203 square inches, if rolled at 1/8-1/4" thick.)*
- [One batch of icing](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/royal-icing-for-a-gingerbread-house-3575000) for each person.
- Candies/Approved Ingredients (Determine with your group in advance.)

## Launch the Attack
*TBD: Need to determine an appropriate attack that is stgrong enough to take down houses, but not strong enough to obliterate all easily (hopefully some will stand and some will fall). Thinking about a slignshot with ping pong balls, tennis balls, etc... pellets might be too strong?*

## Tips for Hosting the Challenge
- The baking and building will likely need to occur on different days unless you plan on spending all day together. You can either trust that everyone can bake their own gingerbread according to standards (and decide if you're going to verify), or one person can bake it for everyone. If one person is baking it for everyone, the participants will need to submit the templates of how they need the gingerbread cut and cooked so that on the day of it will be ready to build.
